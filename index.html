    Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, grasslands, tundra, wetlands, and oceans provide habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. The term wildlife does not necessarily include domesticated animals, such as dogs, cats, pigs, and cattle, unless they have returned to the wild. The global wildlife population is important for maintaining ecological health and biodiversity. Humans have caused much impact on wildlife, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, pollution, overexploitation, and climate change. Humans have also been responsible for the extinction of many species. The loss of wildlife is also problematic for the ecosystem as a whole. The loss of a single species can have significant cascading effects on the entire ecosystem. The conservation of wildlife is important for the health of ecosystems and the planet as a whole. Wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting wild species and their habitats in order to maintain healthy wildlife populations and ecosystems. There are many organizations and individuals working to conserve wildlife, from local grassroots efforts to international organizations. The IUCN Red List is the most widely recognized assessment of the global conservation status of plant and animal species. It is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the global conservation status of biological species. The list uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of species, including the rate of decline, population size, area of geographic range, and degree of fragmentation of a species.</p>
